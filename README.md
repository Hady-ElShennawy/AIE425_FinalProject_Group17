# AIE425 Final Project - Group 17

## Advanced Recommender Systems Analysis

This repository contains the final project for the AIE425 course (Intelligent Recommender Systems). It explores advanced techniques in recommender systems, focusing on dimensionality reduction and domain-specific recommendation strategies using the Amazon dataset.

The project is divided into two main sections:

### [Section 1: Dimensionality Reduction](./SECTION1_DimensionalityReduction/readme_SECTION1.md)
This section delves into various dimensionality reduction techniques applied to recommender systems. It explores methods like **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** and **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** to handle sparse data and improve recommendation efficiency.

*   **Key Techniques**: PCA with MLE, PCA with Mean Filling, SVD Analysis.
*   **Documentation**: [Read more in Section 1](./SECTION1_DimensionalityReduction/readme_SECTION1.md)

### [Section 2: Domain-Specific Recommender System](./SECTION2_DomainRecommender/README_SECTION2.md)
This section implements a comprehensive recommender system tailored for the **Amazon "Health & Household"** domain. It utilizes a hybrid approach combining content-based and collaborative filtering to provide personalized recommendations and address challenges like the cold-start problem.

*   **Key Features**: Content-Based Filtering, Item-Based Collaborative Filtering, Hybrid Models (Weighted, Switching, Cascade), Cold-Start Simulation, Sustainability-aware features ("is_green").
*   **Documentation**: [Read more in Section 2](./SECTION2_DomainRecommender/README_SECTION2.md)

## Getting Started

To explore the project:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hady-ElShennawy/AIE425_FinalProject.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a section**:
    Each section functions independently with its own `code`, `data`, and `results` directories. Please refer to the specific README in each section for detailed installation and usage instructions.

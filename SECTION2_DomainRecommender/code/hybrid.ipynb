                "1.  **Content-Based Systems**: Excel at recommending niche or new items based on features (Description, Metadata) but fail to capture \"serendipity\" or community trends. They are limited by the quality of the feature engineering.\n",
                "2.  **Collaborative Filtering**: Excels at capturing complex latent patterns and community wisdom but suffers catastrohpically from the **Cold-Start Problem** (new users/items) and **Sparsity** (inadequate overlap between users).\n",
